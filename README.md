#setup

you will need to add your google maps api keys (ios and Android) in two places
```
android/app/src/main/_AndroidManifest.xml
```
then rename the file to AndroidManifest.xml

and

```
ios/Runner/_AppDelegate.swift
```
then rename the file to AppDelegate.swift

you will find a string similar to "ADD YOUR KEY HERE" in each file in the place where you should put the key
